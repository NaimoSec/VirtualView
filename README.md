# VirtualView

I've made this in 2016 and that I've updated in 2017.
I've used the base of 3D & JFX.

Virtual View allows you to put a Background Picture and place a Door/Windows whatever on the background.
There is a quick video allowing you to see how it does work :).

Menu is using CSS, feel free to use it for your own projects.
